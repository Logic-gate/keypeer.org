The keypeer project provides an api key intermediary service. It aims to serve the following goals:

  * give user communities access to services that would otherwise require proprietary software
  * free developers to provide access to paid services
  * provide a service / application agnostic api to act as an intermediary
  * minimize the storing and transmission of personal data 
  * store keypeer data using modern homomorphic cryptography
