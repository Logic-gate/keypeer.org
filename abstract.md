The keypeer project provides an API key intermediary service. It will:

  * give communities access to services otherwise requiring proprietary softwares
  * provide paid services for users of free and open source software (FOSS)
  * provide a service / application agnostic api intermediary
  * minimize the storing and transmission of personal data

keypeer enables FOSS developers to include a paid service in their application and enable it for a user who has donated. With keypeer, software users can contribute to the costs of API usage.

An example: although the Open Street Map dataset is freely available, it must be processed to appear as map tiles or for routing. Payment of the processing services is through application API keys which require the application developer to pay for the service provided to end users. keypeer will connect payments, users and service use.

The web service, in REST, will be prototyped in the Python and C++. Client side code will initially be prototyped in javascript and C++.

We will network with other projects to create a financial commons with transparent financials.  An example intermediary, [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/europe).
