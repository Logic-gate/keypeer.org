The keypeer will establish a bridge linking end-users and complex online services, the bridge that is missing for free and open source software (FOSS). By allowing end-users to pay for services, it will allow to support services based on open data with transparent payment model instead of privacy abusing ones.

In its core, keypeer provides an API key intermediary service. It will:
- give FOSS communities access to services otherwise requiring proprietary software
- provide a service / application agnostic API intermediary
- minimize the storing and transmission of personal data

Keypeer enables FOSS developers to include a paid service in their application and enable it for a paying users. With keypeer, end-users can contribute to the service costs.

An example: although the OpenStreetMap dataset is freely available, it must be processed for visualization or routing. This requires resources that can be payed for by end-users via keypeer. 

The web service, in REST, will be prototyped in the Python and C++ together with the client side code.

We will network with other projects to create a financial commons with transparent financials, such as OpenCollective.
