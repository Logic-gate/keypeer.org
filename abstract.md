The keypeer project provides an API key intermediary service. It will:

  * give communities access to services otherwise requiring proprietary software
  * provide paid services for users of free and open source software (FOSS)
  * provide a service / application agnostic api intermediary
  * minimize the storing and transmission of personal data 
keypeer enables FOSS developers to include a paid third party service in their application and enable it for a user who has donated. Software users are enabled to contribute to the costs of api usage of a variety of apis.

An example. Although the Open Street Maps dataset is freely available, it has to be processed to be served as map tiles and for search/routing. Payment of the services is through application API keys which require the application developer to pay for the service provided to end users. 

The web service keypeer, in REST, will be prototyped in the Python and C++. Client side code will initially be prototyped in javascript and c++. 

We will network with a variety of projects to create a financial commons with transparent financials.  An example intermediary, [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/europe).
