The keypeer project is an api key service.

For developers of Free Open Software (FOSS), keypeer enables them to include a paid service (third party service) in their application and enable it for a user who has donated without having an ongoing business relationship and without storing that user's personal data.

Often developers simply can't fund the use of third party data or services. Keypeer connects them to users who collectively can supply the financial support.

keypeer enables users to support third party service use in FOSS apps and benifit from those services that they might individually not be able to access without sacrificing privacy. Users often lacks simple and transparent ways to support a project financially and to combine this with the use of the software.

keypeer itself does not accept payment but only registers an anonymous user key / token and associates it to a project related third party service (API key). Management of the payments will be done by a not-for-profit.
